These are a few Prolog Built-\/ins

Support for file name resolution through absolute\+\_\+file\+\_\+name/3 and friends. These utility built-\/ins are used by load\+\_\+files/2 to search in the library directories. They use pre-\/compiled paths plus environment variables and registry information to search for files.

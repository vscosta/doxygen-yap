%%  read_history(+History, +Help, +DontStore, +Prompt, -Term, -Bindings)
%
%   Give a prompt using Prompt. The sequence '%w' is substituted with the
%   current event number. Then read a term from the input stream and perform
%   the history expansion. Return the expanded term and the bindings of the
%   variables as with read/2.
%   entering the term History makes read_history/5 print the history.
%   Help specifies the help command.
%   DontStore is a list of events that need not be stored.

%   When read_history reads a term of the form $silent(Goal), it will
%   call Goal and pretend it has not seen anything.  This hook is used
%   by the GNU-Emacs interface to for communication between GNU-EMACS
%   and SWI-Prolog.
